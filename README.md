# laravel-phpinsights-action

> [!WARNING]
> This Action has been archived.    
> If you want to run [phpinsights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights) in your project, you can achieve this by using a simple workflow like this.

```yaml
name: PHP Insights
on: push
jobs:
  phpinsights:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2

    - uses: ramsey/composer-install@v3

    - name: Run phpinsights
      run: php artisan insights -n
```

---

This GitHub Action executes Laravel Artisan Command ofÂ [phpinsights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/phpinsights). The output of the Insights Command can be viewed in the Actions log.

You can optionally define minimum values for Insights categories. If the value falls below your given threshold, the run fails.

### Usage

This Action doesn't install composer dependencies on it's own and doesn't contain a `phpinsights` binary.

It's therefore required that `phpinsights` is set as a dependency in your project and that another Action installs the composer dependencies.

An example Workflow can look like this.

```yaml
name: PHP Insights

on: push

jobs:
  phpinsights:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - uses: MilesChou/composer-action@master
      with:
        args: install -q --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-scripts --no-suggest --no-progress --prefer-dist

    - uses: stefanzweifel/laravel-phpinsights-action@v1.1.1
```


### Arguments

You can pass any valid `phpinsights` argument to the Action. In this example, all issues are always displayed and a minimum value of 80 has to be achieved in all categories.

```yaml
name: PHP Insights

on: push

jobs:
  phpinsights:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - uses: MilesChou/composer-action@master
      with:
        args: install -q --no-ansi --no-interaction --no-scripts --no-suggest --no-progress --prefer-dist

    - uses: stefanzweifel/laravel-phpinsights-action@v1.1.1
      with:
        args: -v --min-quality=80 --min-complexity=80 --min-architecture=80 --min-style=80 --disable-security-check
```
